A own implementation of a shell

## Goals

* Learn UNIX more
* Learn rust more, try not to rely on shell impls in rust, but learn it the hard way
* As long as I don't know how dirty code and programs look, I can not build clean code and programs
* Build something I would use, with the approach the build a minimal working program
  and improve it while reaching its limits


## Todo

- [ ] Make Signal Handling proper (use rustyline or signal_hook?)
- [ ] Implement PATH search and correct command handling (depending on slash)
- [ ] Handle command splitting
- [ ] Handle piping
- [ ] Make Alias System
