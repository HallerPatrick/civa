A own implementation of a shell

## Goals

* Learn UNIX more
* Learn rust more, try not to rely on shell impls in rust, but learn it the hard way
* As long as I don't know how dirty code and programs look, I can not build clean code and programs
* Build something I would use, with the approach the build a minimal working program
  and improve it while reaching its limits


## Todo

- [x] Make Signal Handling proper (use rustyline or signal_hook?)
- [ ] Implement PATH search and correct command handling (depending on slash)
- [x] Handle command splitting
- [ ] Handle piping
- [ ] Make Alias System
- [ ] Clip Board
- [x] Improve UI
- [ ] Integration of SVN
- [ ] Thinking of ways to improve shell workflows (own opinion)
- [ ] Build a config system (python?)
- [ ] Tests! (look for good mock library)
- [ ] Read more
